<h3><a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Nárrenme</h3>

<p>In English, nárrenme means "narrate to me." What does that mean to you?</p>

<p>It could mean a lot of things: a child asking older ones to read a bedtime story to her, a student working with friends to write a story, a teacher asking students to read a passage for him, and the list goes on. To us, nárrenme means all of these things and more... nárrenme means the endless possibilities of reading stories. To that end, we started Nárrenme to expand the possibilites of reading through innovative technology.</p>


<h3><a id="do" class="anchor" href="#do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What We Do</h3>

<p>We create high-quality, easily accessible e-books and narrated videos for grade school students learning Spanish and/or English. We do this through the following dynamic, student-led process.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Start with exciting content that makes reading and learning fun.</li>
      <li>Turn this into adaptable and interactive digital media.</li>
      <li>Share all of this with students and classrooms everywhere.</li>
  </ol>

<h3><a id="partner" class="anchor" href="#partner" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Partner With Us</h3>

<p>Whether you're a student, teacher, or organization, there's a way for you to join us in advocating for reading and learning. Do you want to integrate our e-books and videos as a class activity? Let students write and illustrate original content? Or have a better idea (you probably do)?</p>

<p>We're open to anything that promotes our mission, and we'd love to work with anyone who believes in our cause. Just drop us a message <a href="#contact">below</a>. Remember, we work completely as volunteers and give everything we create back to the commons.</p>
